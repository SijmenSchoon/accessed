Accessed Readme file
====================
Accessed is a simple plugin to control your server using sockets.

Socket Commands
===============
The commands you can send to TCP port 7040:
* reload <plugin>      - Reloads the given plugin. Do NOT reload Accessed with this.
* reloadall            - Reloads all plugins, except Accessed.
* command <command>    - Executes the given command. "command reload" won't reload Accessed.

The commands I am planning to add:
* say <message>                    - Broadcasts the message over the console
* kick <user> (r:reason)           - Kicks the user (with the given reason, if given)
* ban <user> <period> (r:reason)   - Bans the user (with the given reason, if given)
                                       (for unlimited time, set period to 0)
* list                             - Returns a user list
